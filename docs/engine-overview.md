# Engine Overview

The simulator walks an authored Timeline of Stages, resolves each hit against a live Stat Table maintained by the Buff Engine, and emits a Simulation Log of Action/Hit/Buff events. This page is the map: it names the major moving parts and points at the concept page for each.

**Source files:** `src/lib/engine-bootstrap.ts`, `src/lib/engine/buff-engine.ts`, `src/lib/stage.ts`, `src/lib/damage/compute-damage.ts`, `src/types/simulation-log.ts`

## How it works

At the highest level:

1. **Bootstrap** (`src/lib/engine-bootstrap.ts`) — for each team slot, resolve character + loadout into base stats and seed permanent buff instances (passive buffs, weapon effects, echo set bonuses).
2. **Timeline walk** (`src/lib/stage.ts` and the simulator loop) — iterate Timeline Entries in order. For each entry, fetch its Stage, apply any Stage Variant, schedule its Damage Entries against the frame clock.
3. **Per-hit resolution** — at each Damage Entry's frame, the Buff Engine ticks expirations, dispatches the `hitLanded` event through its Phase Pipeline (`resource → stat → negStatus → emitHit → coordHit → convert → consume → removeBuffs`), resolves a Stat Table snapshot, and runs the damage formula in `src/lib/damage/compute-damage.ts`. The `emitHit`/`coordHit` phases do **not** resolve synthetic hits inline — they surface _emit decisions_ (`DeferredEmit`s) for the simulation to resolve in frame order (ADR-0028).
4. **The frame-ordered stream** (`schedule.ts` + `simulation.ts`) — synthetic emits, swap-stage trailing hits, and footing commits are all members of one pending-work pool keyed by landing frame: the `Schedule<Work>` module (`src/lib/schedule.ts`). The `Schedule` owns ordering, the watermark drain, within-frame stability, and the same-character drop/pad/reset collision policy (`resolveArrival`); **resolution stays in `simulation.ts`**, supplied as a `resolve` callback to `drainUpTo` — so the `Schedule` imports nothing from the buff engine, damage formulas, or Simulation Log. Before every engine advance, `advanceTo(ctx, F)` drains the pool `≤ F` first — the engine clock is monotonic (`tickToFrame` only moves forward), so a member must resolve before the clock passes its frame or its snapshot would be taken at the overshot frame. Emissions are footing-blind and fire-and-forget; trailing hits and footing commits carry their ADR-0018/0022 drop/pad/reset semantics, which the `Schedule` realizes by tombstoning members (drop/reset) plus a cursor pad rule.
5. **Logging** (`src/types/simulation-log.ts`) — every Action, Hit, and Buff lifecycle transition emits onto the Simulation Log for inspection.

## Modules

Modules are grouped into sub-folders under `src/lib/`:

- **`engine/`** — buff pipeline core: `buff-engine` (coordinator, Phase Pipeline), `instance-store`, `resource-ledger`, `on-field-tracker`, `emit-hit-dispatcher`, `apply-stat-effects` (per-hit `stat`-effect fold + hit matchers), `condition-evaluator`, `trigger-index`. See [buff-engine](buff-engine.md).
- **`damage/`** — pure formulas: `compute-damage`, `compute-healing`, `hit-formula`.
- **`timeline/`** — timeline tooling: `validate-timeline`, `migrate-timeline`, `timeline-summary`, `timeline-render-items`, `timeline-group-formatting`, `timeline-drag-preview`.
- **`loadout/`** — slot resolution: the per-entity peers `resolve-character`, `resolve-weapon`, `resolve-echo` (each owning its entity's base stats + BuffDefs) composed by the `resolve-slot` coordinator (`resolveSlot → { baseStats, buffDefs }`), plus `catalog` (lookups), `template` / `team-ops` (authoring), and `echo-stat-constants`.
- **`stage.ts`** — stage resolution (one Timeline Entry → one Stage); at `src/lib/` root.
- **`trailing-window.ts`** — pure helpers (`partitionStage`, `isCancelCapable`) splitting a swap stage's hits into immediate vs. trailing; consumed by `simulation.ts`. The former per-character state machine dissolved onto the frame-ordered stream (ADR-0028). At `src/lib/` root.
- **`schedule.ts`** — the `Schedule<Work>` frame-ordered pending-work pool: ordering, the watermark drain, and the same-character drop/pad/reset collision policy (`resolveArrival`). Mechanism-only and generic over its payload — resolution runs in a caller-supplied callback, so it imports nothing from the engine, damage, or log (ADR-0028). At `src/lib/` root.
- **`engine-bootstrap.ts`** — bridges `loadout/` and `engine/`; stays at `src/lib/` root.
- **`simulation.ts`** — top-level orchestrator; owns resolution and drives the `Schedule`. Stays at `src/lib/` root.

The sidebar's clickable stage catalog (`focused-stage-catalog`) is co-located with its sole consumer in `src/components/skills/`, not under `src/lib/`.
